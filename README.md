# transfr
Transfr is a library for transferring files quickly between a client and server. Transfer is coordinated over a TCP connection and data is transferred via several UDP connections concurrently. Transferring data over UDP removes the overhead and throughput issues associated with TCP while maintaining some amount of transfer guarantees by coordinating over TCP.

See the wiki for information on progress!
